# hairhaus-website-22
New website for Hairhaus

Background image (logo) is centered and fixed (does not scroll).

Commented out background color black while working, for visibility.

Navbar ul and li added, format not set

Added business name above navlinks

Navlinks need spacing adjusted: first and last should line up with edges of background image, all should be equally spaced
