Footer is stuck to the bottom after page content. 

About page added

Google map added to contact page

Commented out the Scheduling link in the navbar, scheduling will be on the Services page

Services page added with placeholder for a scheduling app

max 460 media query for Index and About pages done. Issue with gap on right of footer on About only. 

max 460 media query for Services page done.

Added margins left and right to ABOUT div and resolved the footer gap.

Contact page media query: issue with google map resize

Changes to media queries: one of the big issues with the max-width: 480 is that the business-name header was too large. index file is ok at all sizes except footer should be stuck to bottom (there's a small gap).
